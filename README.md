# Cars-Tuning (Website project)

## About

An example of a car tuning company website with a well-planned UI with an emphasis on aesthetics. The website has little JavaScript code due to the fact that in this project I focused mainly on design. There are two forms available - a newsletter subscription form and a contact form.

**This project is an extension of a project from one of the courses.**
